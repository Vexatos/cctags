Tag printer extends writer functionality by adding methods to change visible tag properties. Added methods:
int inkLevel() - return current ink level
bool print([string icon], [string label]) - print (or remove if argument is omited/nil) new icon (and optional label) on currently inserted tag
Peripheral still has all writer methods (see 'help tag_writer'). Every printing will use one unit of ink. Refuel by using black ink on block. Currently, no visible tag property can be read by any peripheral.
