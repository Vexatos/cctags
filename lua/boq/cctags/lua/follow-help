follow is program that allows to use tags for controlling turtle. Program works by executing code found on tags.
Arguments:
<peripheral side> - on which side is mounted tag reader/printer
<move forward on start = true> (optional) - if true, turtle will move one block before searching for tags 
<max security level = 2> (optional) - for security purposes, expressions are executed in limited scope. This parameter descibes, how much code on tag can do. See 'api/tags' for full list.

If first argument is equal to 'print' instead of moving program will print all functions available on current level and return.

Any executed code can use two additional variables:
reader - peripheral side, copied program from parameters
tagDir - where is tag containing currently executed code
serial - serial id of currently scanned tag
prev() - call previous command

Any variable or function defined by code will persist between commands until program ends.

Program will work until one of two things happen:
- no new tag is found
- code explicitly calls 'stop()'

Functions 'forward()', 'back()', 'up()', 'down()' will cause turtle to move until tag is found.
