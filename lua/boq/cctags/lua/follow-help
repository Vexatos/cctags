follow is program that allows to use tags for turtle controlling. Program executed any code read from tags found by turtle.

Arguments:
<peripheral side> - on which side is mounted tag reader/printer
<move forward on start = true> (optional) - if true, turtle will move one block before searching for tags 
<max security level = 2> (optional) - for security purposes, expressions are executed in limited scope. This parameter descibes, how much code on tag can do. See api/tags for full list.

Any executed code can use two additional variables:
reader - peripheral side, copied program from parameters
tagDir - where is tag containing currently executed code

Program will work until one of two things happen:
- no new tag is found
- code explicitly calls 'stop()'
