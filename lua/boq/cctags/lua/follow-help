follow is program that allows to use tags for controlling turtle. Program works by executing code found on tags.
Arguments:
<peripheral side> - on which side is mounted tag reader/printer
<move forward on start = true> (optional) - if true, turtle will move one block before searching for tags 

If first argument is equal to 'print' instead of moving program will print all functions available on current level and return.

Any executed code can use two additional variables:
reader - wrapped peripheral used to read current tag
tagDir - where is tag containing currently executed code
serial - serial id of currently scanned tag
prev() - call previous command
holdPrev() - don't replace prev() with current instruction
pushPreamble(function) - push new preamble (function called after tag is interpreted) to stack
top pushPreamble() - pop preamble from stack

Any variable or function defined by code will persist between commands until program ends.

Program will work until one of two things happen:
- no new tag is found
- code explicitly calls 'stop()'

Functions 'forward()', 'back()', 'up()', 'down()' will cause turtle to move until tag is found.
