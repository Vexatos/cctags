progtag can be used to write tag contents according to definitions from text file. Every line in that file has following format:
quantity, [icon], [label] ; contents
Part before semicolon can be ommited. Lines starting with "--" are treated as comments.
Example file:
-- test
1, foo ; print("Hello ") a = "world"
2, bar, xyzzy ; print(a)
