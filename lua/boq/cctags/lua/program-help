progtag can be used to write tag contents according to definitions from file. Every line in file should have following format:
quantity, [icon], [label] : contents
Instead of comma, any other combination of non-alphanumeric characters can be used as separator. 
Part before colon can be ommited. Lines starting with "--" are treated as comments.
Example file:
-- default program
1 forward Start : forward(reader) a = 2
1 right Right : turnRight() forward(reader)
1 no Stop : print("Done a=".. a) stop()
