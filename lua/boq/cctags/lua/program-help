progtag can be used to write tag contents according to definitions from file. Every line in file should be in one of following forms:
for default tags: quantity [icon] [label] : contents
for tags from library: quantity @ library_id
Part before colon can be ommited. Lines starting with "--" are treated as comments.
Example file:
-- default program
1 forward Start : forward() a = 2
1 right Right : turnRight() forward()
1 no Stop : print("Done a=".. a) stop()
