Tag printer extends writer functionality by adding methods to change visible tag properties. New methods:
int inkLevel() - return current ink level
int loadInk([int slot = current]) - consume ink item from slot
bool print([string icon], [string label]) - print (or remove if argument is omited/nil) new icon (and optional label) on inserted tag
Every printing will use one unit of ink. Currently, no visible tag property can be read by any peripheral. Peripheral still has all writer methods (see 'help tag_writer')
