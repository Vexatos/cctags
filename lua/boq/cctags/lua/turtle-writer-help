Tag writer is peripheral that allows reading and writing tag contents.
Available methods:
bool scanForTag([string direction = "front"]) - scan for tags on nearby blocks and select first found. Possible argument values: "front", "back", "up", "down", "left", "right"
bool selectFromSlot([int slot = current]) - select tag from inventory. Works only for single tags.
bool isTagValid() - is currently selected tag valid?
string,int contents() - read selected tag contents
result,int write(str) - write new data to selected tag
bool print([string icon], [string label]) - print (or remove if argument is omited/nil) new icon (and optional label) on inserted tag
string,int size() - get selected tag size as (size_description, size_in_bytes) pair
int serial() - get serial id of selected tag
string,string,string library(string id) - get tag data from library (returns contents,icon,label)
int inkLevel() - return current ink level
int loadInk([int slot = current]) - consume ink item from slot

Every printing will use one unit of ink. Currently, no visible tag property can be read by any peripheral. Peripheral still has all writer methods (see 'help tag_writer')
